1578 Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece. (low)
1579 Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world - class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential. (low)

1625 It 's difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of American Chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view. (low)
1626 The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace. (high)
